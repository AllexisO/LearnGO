# LearnGO

*Lesson 2. Package*
- All package files should be in the same directory.
Example: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/username/learngo/second_lesson/explain/packages/what`

- All files should belong to the same package (_package main_, _package x_, _package y_ etc.)

- Package clause.
You can use package clause in a file to let GO know that which package that file belongs to.
Example:
`package main` --> package clause, this should be the first code and it can only appear once.
